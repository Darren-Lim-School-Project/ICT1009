# Week 1
## Project Description
A game in which players hunt different type mice using an array of cats and upgrades, in order to obtain gold and points. Player's choices (bait, trap, base, etc.) will affect what the type and success rate of their captures.

In addition to it being a web app (naturally *multiplayer*), we plan to have scenarios which will allow players to cooperate with each other (in real time) to capture mice. We plan to take advantage of WebSockets to make this experience as seamless as possible.

It will be a Single Page Application (SPA) written with Vue.js, backed by a Spring Boot based back-end (API). 

## Game name
Rodent raid.
